# VictoryPie Changelog

## 14.0.2 (2018-03-27)

-[168](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-pie/pull/168) Refactor helper method exports

## 14.0.1 (2018-02-05)

- [167](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-pie/pull/167) Add `sideEffects: false`

## 14.0.0 (2018-02-04)

-[166](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-pie/pull/166) Update Victory primitives
**This is a breaking change**
Internal methods for _all_ Victory primitive components have changed. This will be a breaking change for users who are extending primitive components, including `victory-native`.

## 13.3.1 (2018-01-08)

-[164](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-pie/pull/164) Correct typo

## 13.3.0 (2018-01-02)

- [163](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-pie/pull/163)
- [victory-core/324](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/324) Adds support for external event mutations
  - Adds `externalEventMutations` prop to `VictorySharedEvents` and all components enhanced with the `add-events` HOC
  - `externalEventMutations` prop format:
  ```
externalEventMutations: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({
  callback: PropTypes.function,
  childName: PropTypes.oneOfType([
    PropTypes.string,
    PropTypes.array
  ]),
  eventKey: PropTypes.oneOfType([
    PropTypes.array,
    CustomPropTypes.allOfType([CustomPropTypes.integer, CustomPropTypes.nonNegative]),
    PropTypes.string
  ]),
  mutation: PropTypes.function,
  target: PropTypes.oneOfType([
    PropTypes.string,
    PropTypes.array
  ])
}))
```
*Note:* `eventKey` and `target` must be specified for externalEventMutations. When using `extenalEventMutations` with shared events (_i.e._ events on VictoryChart etc), `childName` is also required.

*Note:* The `callback` supplied to `externalEventMutations` should be used for clearing mutations. This is crucial for animating charts

## 10.0.0 (2017-01-16)

- Uses "_x" and "_y" for internal data format rather than "x" and "y". Though "x" and "y" will
still appear in the data object, they are no longer the source of truth for data values. This may be
a breaking change for custom transitions, functional props, and functional styles.

- Ensure that animations and transitions use the global timer passed in context or create their own

## 7.1.2 (2016-11-11)

- Fix tooltip bug. Force `renderInPortal={false}` for VictoryPie tooltips

## 7.1.1 (2016-10-31)

- Stricter npmignore

## 7.1.0 (2016-10-28)

- Uses `publishr` to reduce npm installed package size [#413](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/issues/413)

## 7.0.1 (2016-10-26)

- allow npm 2 install
- add shouldAnimate check for victory-native compatibility

## 7.0.0 (2016-10-13)

    - Extracts event logic into a new inverted inheritance higher order component `addEvents` which is used by all chart components

## 6.0.0 (2016-09-09)

**This release includes breaking changes for themes and label styles**
- Adds support for `VictoryTooltip`
- Adds a `labelRadius` prop used to position labels rather than relying only on `style.labels.padding`
- Calculates default `textAnchor` and `verticalAnchor` for labels depending on which quadrant of the pie they appear in
- Uses `Slice` component exported from `victory-core`
- Performance improvements

## 5.0.0 (2016-08-18)

**This release includes breaking changes for themes and label styles**
- Updates VictoryTheme API, uses `VictoryTheme.grayscale` for default styling
- Alters label placement so that when label styles include padding, the `innerRadius` of the pie does not effect label placement.
- Adds a `displayName` for ease of debugging
- Updates documentation to reflect changes

## 4.3.1 (2016-08-02)

- Update documentation

## 4.3.0 (2016-07-29)

- Performance improvements
- Update `victory-core` to remove `reduce-calc-css`

## 4.2.0 (2016-07-02)

- Adds support for themes
- Adds support for Victory Native

## 4.1.0 (2016-06-17)

- Supports events on the parent element via the `parent` namespace in the `events` prop.
- `parent` events have access to `width`, `height`, `style` and the calculated `slices` and the calculated `pathFuncton`
- When mutating elements via the return from event handlers, mutation objects may now take arrays for `eventKey` to target several individual elements, or the special value "all" to apply changes to all elements of a particular target type
- Supports a custom `containerComponent` prop, which defaults to `VictoryContainer`
- Adds default aria roles via `VictoryContainer`
- Adds support for a `cornerRadius` prop. Thanks @judikdavid!
- Renders all slices _before_ labels so that labels are not overlapped.


## 4.0.0 (2016-06-01)

- Upgrades to React 15
- Updates the events API to support shared events **This is a breaking change for events**

## 3.0.0 (2016-05-13)

 - improves consistency for `labelComponent` and `dataComponent` props. Replaces a custom `SliceLabel` component with `VictoryLabel` to make the api more consistent and predictable. **This is a breaking change for custom label components**, as `VictoryLabel` expects a different set of props than the previous `SliceLabel` component. See [VictoryLabel](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-label) for more detail.

- Functional styles and props are now all evaluated before they are passed as props to `labelComponent` or `dataComponent`, so that custom components will have access to the final values.

- events are bound and partially applied prior to being passed as props to `labelComponent` or `dataComponent`

- it is now possible to specify `angle` and `verticalAnchor` props for` VictoryLabel` via the style object

- event return values are stored differently on state to facilitate interaction between data and labels. **This is a breaking change for events** as event handlers must now return an object with with `data` and/or `labels` keys so that these values may be applied appropriately to data and label elements respectively.

- improved integration tests

## 2.1.0 (2016-04-15)

- Add support for custom data components
- Add support for enter and exit transitions, and add default transitions

## 2.0.0 (2016-03-15)

- Extracted shared code into `victory-util`

## 0.3.0 (2016-01-26)

- Upgrade to Radium 0.16.2. This is a breaking change if you're using media queries or keyframes in your components. Please review upgrade guide at https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/blob/master/docs/guides/upgrade-v0.16.x.md

## 0.2.0 Alpha (2015-12-16)

Functional styles for data (each pie slice) and labels. Styles may be given as a function of `data`, where data is each data object in the array provided to `props.data`

Basic code coverage.

We make no promises about any code prior to this release.
